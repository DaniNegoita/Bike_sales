Overview

This dynamic dashboard takes inspiration from @AlexTheAnalyst project in Excel. I took up a Customer Segmentation approach by looking at demographic attributes (e.g., age) and behaviors (e.g. cars ownership). Use case examples: inform brand’s reach out to various customer segments, create new products, increase customers’ loyalty. 

Workflow Steps 

--Cleaning--

1. Duplicates check
2. Assigned value labels to the string variables "Marital Status" and "Gender"
3. Removed irrelevant columns. 

--Aggregation--

Generated 4 age groups using a nested IF formula upon the "Age" column.

-Analysis-

Visual analysis using bar, line, and pie plots built upon pivot tables. To unlock further insights, Slicers based on Gender, Marital Status and Number of Cars were added.
